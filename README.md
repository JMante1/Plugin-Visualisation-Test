# Plugin-Visualisation-Test
A very small test plugin to test the visualisation interface is working for SynBioHub. Could be the basis for python based visualisation plugins.

# Install
Pull the docker image from https://hub.docker.com/r/synbiohub/plugin-visualisation-test or using python run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the requirements. Then run FLASK_APP=app python -m flask run. A flask module will run at localhost:5000/.
